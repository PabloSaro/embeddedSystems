Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,696 out of  15,360   11%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             3,341 out of  15,360   21%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          2,241 out of   7,680   29%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   2,241 out of   2,241 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   2,241   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       3,483 out of  15,360   22%
    Number used as logic:             2,553
    Number used as a route-thru:        142
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     704
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:      84

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 29 out of     173   16%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       4
    IOB Latches:                          8
  Number of RAMB16s:                     17 out of      24   70%
  Number of MULT18X18s:                   3 out of      24   12%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     3 out of       8   37%
